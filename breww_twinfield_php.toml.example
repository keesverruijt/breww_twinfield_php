  # Sales transaction lines in Twinfield need to be booked to some 'sales' dimension; this seems
  # to be fixed to a four digit numeric value in Twinfield. Twinfield uses this to book the sales
  # to a particular part of your company. In Brouwdok we use this to differentiate sales of 
  # bottles and kegs from wholesale deals where we sell entire brews to other brewers.
  # Anyway, the solution chosen here is that you need to create a TAG in Breww on every product,
  # For us this tag is "GBTF<nnnn>-<explanation>". 
  # The regex example says: GBTF, followed by the first group which is exactly four digits, maybe
  # followed by a - and then other stuff.
